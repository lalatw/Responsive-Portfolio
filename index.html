        <img id="myphoto" src="assets/images/photo.JPG" alt="This is me">
        <p>I am an experienced Project Management Professional with over eight years of experience in the high-tech industry. In the past four years, I’ve been focusing my career on managing extensive software development projects. In my daily work, I constantly communicate and interact with engineering, design, and QA groups. I found that advanced technical skill set has become increasingly vital when it comes to strategic planning and problem solving. 
        <br><br>
        With this in mind, I am eager to enhance my programming skills and knowledge through fundamentals of learning.  It’s never easy to learn new “languages”, but I’m really enjoying it.  Look what I can build from scratch!
